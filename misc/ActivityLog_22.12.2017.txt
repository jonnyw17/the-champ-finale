Cypress.io did work due to some malware problem

[15:34]

Looking into the problem sooner, due to a malware issue.
The IP Address within the house has been blacklisted.
So I'll need to these 2 steps; before using Cypress.

Another thing, that I can deduce from this - 2 possible
scenarios;

  1) there was some form of malware that must have existed
  on the SpaceportX network. Managed to latch onto my local
  machine somehow.
  We can double check this by going back to SpaceportX, using
  any website that using CloudFlares

  OR

  2) The Malware must have entered the network, via some device
  that is not my laptop.
    - Could be my
    - My Mobile
    - Other people's devices in the house

Solution

> Check Malware Origin

A) Check next time whether you can use Cypress.io, in SpaceportX.
If it's possible, then the virus must have originated from the house

1) Do a full sweep of everyone's devices - mainly laptops, as phones
are better protected.

2) Find a way to get the house's IP address from being blacklisted.
