We will need to looking to testing scenarios with cucumber.io and gherkin.io
afterwards. Learning about those 2 technologies before the project, would had
been invaluable at the very start.

  - made communication b/w the client, developer and tester (3 Amigos) easier
  - would have kept us on track
  - allow us to easily update stakeholders on the progress of the project
  - if we have integrated CI + CD tools, producing the software would had
    been much easier

Simple - current plan for the next few days

1) Just follow the Trello board.
2) i) High-level overview aim -> Have states set up in App, where the information can update part of the
   application, such as who won; and slowly and remove the throwaway code
3) ii) Place some time out on who to fix the back end
