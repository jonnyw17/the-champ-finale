Planning to use Gherkin + Cucumber for JavaScript BDD.
Not really sure if you can integrate a

Cypress.io - Unit, Integration + Regression Testing; end-to-end testing; TDD
  Use
  - Mocha - Test framework
  - Chai - Assertion Library
  - Sinon, - implement Spies, Stubs, Mocks ?? - Additional Libraries
    [Need to test first]
Cucumber, Gherkin - Criteria Acceptance Testing; BDD - there is
  - Cucumber.js - https://www.npmjs.com/package/cucumber
  - Gherkin.js - https://www.npmjs.com/package/gherkin

https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/unit-testing-nodejs/table-of-contents

 - Testing Business Logic
 - Testing Errors
 - Finding Edge Cases
 - IO and Asynchronous Operations
 - Testing with Mocks
 - Testing Promises
 - Test Coverage

Mock API
Learn how to create a simple Mock API, in JavaScript - how they integrate with Cypress.io

See how
-> Sinon - help, with Spies, Stubs, Mocks
  maybe do later on[json-server] - full fake REST API https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server]
Integrate with Cypress.io.

See how
  Cypress.io - Unit, Integration + Regression Testing; end-to-end testing; TDD
    Use
    - Mocha - Test framework
    - Chai - Assertion Library
    - Sinon, - implement Spies, Stubs, Mocks ?? - Additional Libraries
      [Need to test first]
    - mongo-mock - This is an in-memory 'pretend' mongodb. https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-mock
Integrates with
  Cucumber + Gherkin

However Cucumber + Gherkin are more used for Agile Software Development - not lean.

Checklist

Need to learn
[] Cypress.io - list all the additional features in Cypress, that are required to be learnt
  [] List of all the additional features

[] Integrate mongo-mock - into application, and build a fake mongodb, to call data back and
fourth from https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-mock
[] Integrate Cucumber + Gherkin

Wants to Learn
[] Learn to use Mocha + Chai, in a way where you work more towards BDD
[] Sinon.js - help, with Spies, Stubs, Mocks
- https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/mocha-javascript-testing-nodejs/table-of-contents
[] Learn how to write technical report
- https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/writing-better-technical-reports/table-of-contents

Again we are not asking for full integration; as we still are enable a BE integration of;

- Session Management
- Twitter API

Please change the Checklist + use Example mapping, to make it clear and understandable to all
major stakeholders,
that everyone is on the same page. Cucumber school costs to complete $199.

Time to refresh what I have learnt about Cypress.io; Kurzgesagt

- Will be spending time completing tests for the Champ feature
- Deconstruct the tests I won't dynamically generate the tests, as the code will not be that
flexible - I won't be able to add custom tests on the side - if need be
- Find the best way to organise the tests - I don't think I can do all the tests in order????
Prefer each tests to be modular

Decided to spend more time studying through Cypress.io docs - the decision was made when I
came across user.json profile.json in the fixture directory. That's comes with Cypress.io by
default. This essentially means I can utilise mocking capabilities whilst building the
application, Cypress marketed the fact that it allow devs to mock user data.

Read over all the notes again, and draw up a model of your understanding. These additional
notes are written as if;

  1. Selling the Cypress Product, to a potential
  2. If you were trying to promote the product to a team mate - encourage them to utilize it
