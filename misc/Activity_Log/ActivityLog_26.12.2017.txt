(General)
Notes 1: Tech integrated into the time should,
 - that saves time,
 - helps avoid mistakes.
 - enables better communication
 - Future Support - LTS if possible

Notes 2: Shortcut adoption

When there is any improvement that can save time deterministically,
with little to no trade-off, adopt it with little resistance or learn

Avoiding pain

The main reason why developers, usually are stuck on the problem is
mainly due or these main reasons

- Lack of Knowledge (every kind of Dec)
- ‎Lack of experience in solving the problem
- ‎Misunderstanding the problem domain
- ‎Misunderstanding how to apply the solution to the problem

Avoid a lot more pain

Find a mentor - those experiences and pearls of wisdom.

Also found out, that you can keep everything local, by install npx
on to your local machine. As you can run any program

Use of global modules, should be considered, but for me there should a
way to run these modules locally - not globally.

Plus Yarn can be used to install large modules such as Cypress.io
faster
