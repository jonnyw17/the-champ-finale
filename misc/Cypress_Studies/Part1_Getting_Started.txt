Now it’s time to write our first test. We’re going to:

1. Write our first passing test.
2. Write our first failing test.
3. Watch Cypress reload in real time.

Even without adding an assertion, we know that everything
is okay! This is because many of Cypress’ commands are
built to fail if they don’t find what they’re expecting to find. This is known as a Default Assertion.
