When conditional testing is a good choice for your tests

>Problems: Conditional Testing - may even be considered an anti-pattern
Without question, you want your tests to work 100% of the time, that
would require a single source of immutable truth - this is what makes
conditional testing difficult, thus all your tests must be deterministic.

The problem with conditional testing is that it can only be used when
the state has stabilized. In modern day applications, knowing when
state is stable is oftentimes impossible - the DOM is unstable.

To a human - if something changes 10ms or 100ms from now, we may not
even notice this change and assume the state was always the same.

To a robot - even 10ms represents billions+ of clock cycles. The
timescale difference is incredible.

A human also has intuition. If you click a button and see a loading
spinner, you will assume the state is in flux and will automatically
wait for it to finish.

A robot has no intuition - it will do exactly as it is programmed
to do.

When you can perform conditional testing?
If it's required
The only way to do conditional testing on the DOM is if you are 100%
sure that the state has “settled” and there is no possible way for
it to change.

That is it! In any other circumstance you will have flaky tests if
you try to rely on the state of the DOM for conditional testing.
